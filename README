Grapher
=======

THIS IS PRE-ALPHA SOFTWARE. DON'T TRY THIS QUITE YET.

This plugin lets you store a graph representation of your data in
Redis. ("Graph" as in "Graph Theory", this is NOT charting sofrtware.)

A graph representation of your objects is a very powerful analytical
tool for discovering inter-object relationships that cannot be
discovered easily or nearly as efficiently using a relational
database.
